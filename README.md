## ZippyTube
ZippyTube is a YouTube clone video-streaming SPA using the MERN stack.

### Motivation
The primary motivation behind the creation of this project was to gain a better understanding of integrating a micro-service architecture into a web application. Since I was interested in building a video-streaming application with React, I decided to develop my own app using a microservice architecture.
### Technologies
* <strong>React</strong> for the frontend development library
* <strong>Express</strong> for the backend development framework
* <strong>Node.js</strong> for the runtime environment
* <strong>MongoDB</strong> for NoSQL DBMS
* <strong>Redis</strong> for the distributed cache system
* <strong>Kafka</strong> for the publish subsribe model
* <strong>PM2</strong> for production process manager and a load-balancer
* <strong>Amazon EC2</strong> for deployment purposes
